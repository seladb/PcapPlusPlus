	 * @class Packet
	 * This class represents a parsed packet. It contains the raw data (RawPacket instance), and a linked list of layers, each layer is a parsed
	 * protocol that this packet contains. The layers linked list is ordered where the first layer is the lowest in the packet (currently it's always
	 * Ethernet protocol as PcapPlusPlus supports only Ethernet packets), the next layer will be L2.5 or L3 (e.g VLAN, IPv4, IPv6, etc.), and so on.
	 * etc.), etc. The last layer in the linked list will be the highest in the packet.
	 * For example: for a standard HTTP request packet the layer will look like this: EthLayer -> IPv4Layer -> TcpLayer -> HttpRequestLayer <BR>
	 * Packet instance isn't read only. The user can add or remove layers, update current layer, etc.
