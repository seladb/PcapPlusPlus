## Reporting a Vulnerability

Our preference is that if you know the fix/solution, you should open a pull request to help the development of the library. With every contribution you provide, the library moves one step further and helps to keep safe all users. But for some reason, if this is not possible, to report a security issue, please email <pcapplusplus@gmail.com> with a description of the vulnerability, the steps you took or simple code piece to reproduce the issue, affected versions, if applicable data sample (preferably `pcap/pcapng`) to reproduce, and, if known, mitigations/fixes for the issue. This project follows a 30 days disclosure timeline.
