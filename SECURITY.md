## Reporting a Bug :bug: :bug:

Simply use GitHub issues to report a bug with related information to debug the issue :pencil:. Please check the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/seladb/PcapPlusPlus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Reporting a Vulnerability :closed_lock_with_key: :eyes:

You can use the GitHub issues to report a vulnerability publicly. But if you find a sensitive security issue and want to report privately :lock:, please email <pcapplusplus@gmail.com> with the following information:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue or a simple code piece
- Affected versions
- If applicable, a data sample (preferably `pcap/pcapng`) to reproduce
- If known, any mitigations or fixes for the issue

If you already looked at the code and found the root cause - that's great :four_leaf_clover:! You can create a GitHub pull request as soon as possible with fix to keep safe everyone.
