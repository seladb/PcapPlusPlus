## Reporting a Vulnerability :eyes: :closed_lock_with_key:

Our preference is that if you know the fix/solution, you should open a pull request to help the development of the library. With every contribution you provide, the library moves one step further and helps to keep safe all users :star:. But for some reason, if this is not possible, to report a security issue :lock:, please email <pcapplusplus@gmail.com> with a description of the vulnerability, the steps you took or simple code piece to reproduce the issue, affected versions, if applicable data sample (preferably `pcap/pcapng`) to reproduce, and, if known, mitigations/fixes for the issue. This project follows a 14 days disclosure timeline. This means that vulnerability will be listed in GitHub issues in 14 days after the report received with `vulnerability` tag :unlock:.
