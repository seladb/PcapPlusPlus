Please close visual studio and run configure-windows-visual-studio.bat
BEFORE OPENING THIS SOLUTION.  It generates variables for dependencies
which are required for building. Alternatively, if you're using a package manager
to provide these dependencies, you must set the following two variables manually:

  set PCAPPLUSPLUS_CONFIG_OVERRIDE=True
  set PCAPPLUSPLUSHOME=path_to_pcapplusplus_repo_root

You can set these as environment variables (shown above),
or pass them as properties to the MSBuild CLI (shown below):

  /p:PCAPPLUSPLUS_CONFIG_OVERRIDE=True
  /p:PCAPPLUSPLUSHOME=path_to_pcapplusplus_repo_root
