Release notes (changes from v24.09)
-----------------------------------

- New protocol support:
  - WireGuard (thanks @nadongjun !)
  - GTPv2
  - Cisco HDLC
  - Add gratuitous ARP requests (thanks @Dimi1010 !)
- Added support for DPDK 23.11 and 24.11
- Added an option to build only Common++ and Packet++ libraries and not Pcap++, hence avoid the dependency on third party libraries like libpcap or WinPcap/Npcap (thanks @Dimi1010 !)
- Introduced nanosecond timestamp precision in TCP reassembly
- Introduced a new benchmark system using Google Benchmark (thanks @egecetin !)
- Added support for timestamp-related libpcap options (thanks @vcomito-apexai !)
- Overhauled the logging infrastructure for better performance and flexibility (thanks @Dimi1010 !)
- Added multi-language README support (Traditional Chinese, Korean) (thanks @tigercosmos, @nadongjun !)
- Removed usage of VLAs (Variable Length Arrays) for C++ standard compliance (thanks @Dimi1010 !)
- Enhanced Python testing and linting infrastructure with `ruff` (thanks @tigercosmos !)
- Reworked `setFilter` handling in libpcap backend
- Updated OS/platform support running in CI: Ubuntu ARM64, Alpine 3.20, Fedora 42, FreeBSD 13.4/14.1, newer macOS runners (thanks @clementperon !)
- Migrated Android build to use the new version of ToyVPN
- Code refactoring:
  - Improve `MacAddress`, `IPAddress` and `IPNetwork` classes (thanks @Dimi1010 !)
  - Improve and modernize `PfRingDevice` (thanks @Dimi1010 !)
  - Refactor device list classes (`PcapLiveDeviceList`, `DpdkDeviceList`, etc.) to use smart pointers internally for memory management and consolidate common behavior under a base class (thanks @Dimi1010 !)
  - Reformat `CMakeLists` files using `gersemi` (thanks @egecetin !)
  - Streamline packet parsing using templated next layer sub-construction (thanks @Dimi1010 !)
  - Numerous C++11 modernization efforts (thanks @Dimi1010, @egecetin, @lumiZGorlic, @kiwixz, @ol-imorozko !)
  - Use a forked version of [`LightPcapNg`](https://github.com/PcapPlusPlus/LightPcapNg) instead of including the sources in the repo
- Many documentation improvements using triple-slash Doxygen formatting (thanks @Dimi1010, @tigercosmos !)
- Tons of bug fixes, security fixes and small improvements (thanks @Dimi1010, @clementperon, @rndx21033, @prudens, @Doekin, @egecetin, @ol-imorozko, @1ndahous3, @fxlb, @jj683, @oss-patch, @enomis101, @Shivam7-1, @orgads, @Alexis-Lapierre, @s-genereux !)

Breaking changes
----------------

- `Logger::LogLevel` was deprecated and moved to `LogLevel`. `LogLevel` is now an `enum class` so arithmetic operations on it will fail to compile
-  Logger copy constructor and copy assignment marked as deleted
- `Packet::getRawPacketReadOnly()` return type changed `RawPacket*` to `RawPacket const*`
- Removed support for SSLv2 (non-functional previously) (thanks @droe !)
- `LightPcapNg` is no longer included in the repo sources and is fetched during the build time

Deprecation list
----------------
- The following methods that were marked as deprecated in previous versions were removed:
  - `PcapLiveDevice::getAddresses()` that was previously deprecated was removed
- `libpcap` versions < 0.9 are no longer supported. Hence, the following CMake options were removed: `PCAPPP_ENABLE_PCAP_IMMEDIATE_MODE` and `PCAPPP_ENABLE_PCAP_SET_DIRECTION`
- The following methods are now marked as deprecated and will be removed in future versions:
  - `Logger::Error`, `Logger::Info`, `Logger::Debug` are deprecated. Please use `LogLevel::XXX`
  - `PcapLiveDeviceList::getPcapLiveDeviceBy***` methods have been deprecated in favour of `PcapLiveDeviceList::getDeviceBy***`
