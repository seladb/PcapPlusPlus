Breaking changes
----------------

This version includes a small number of breaking changes:
- Removed `isValid()` from `MacAddress,` `IPAddress`, `IPv4Address`, `IPv6Address`, instead they throw an exception if the input argument is invalid
- Introduced a new `TcpOptionEnumType`
- Removed the `dummy` argument in `PayloadLayer`'s constructor


Deprecation list
----------------

The following methods that were marked as deprecated in previous versions were removed:
- `IPv4Address::matchSubnet()`

The following methods are now marked as deprecated and will be removed in future versions:
- `PointerVector::getAndRemoveFromVector()` -> replaced by `PointerVector::getAndDetach()`
- `HttpResponseLayer::HttpResponseLayer(version, statusCode, statusCodeString)` -> use other constructors
- `HttpResponseLayer::setStatusCode(newStatusCode, statusCodeString)` -> use the other overload
- `TcpOptionType` enum -> replaced by `TcpOptionEnumType`
- `TcpOption::getTcpOptionType()` -> replaced by `TcpOption::getTcpOptionEnumType()`
- `TcpOptionBuilder::TcpOptionBuilder()` -> use other constructors
- `TcpLayer::getTcpOption(TcpOptionType option)` -> use the other overload
- `TcpLayer::addTcpOptionAfter()` -> replaced by `TcpLayer::insertTcpOptionAfter()`
- `TcpLayer::removeTcpOption()` -> use the other overload
- `PcapLiveDevice::getAddresses()` -> replaced by `PcapLiveDevice::getIPAddresses()`
- `PcapRemoteDeviceList::getRemoteDeviceList()` -> replaced by `PcapRemoteDeviceList::createRemoteDeviceList()`
