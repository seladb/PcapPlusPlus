# Dirent
Dirent is a C/C++ programming interface that allows programmers to retrieve
information about files and directories under Linux/UNIX.  This project
provides Linux compatible Dirent interface for Microsoft Windows.


# Installation

Download the latest Dirent installation package from
[softagalleria.net](http://softagalleria.net/download/dirent/?C=M;O=D)

Unpack the installation file with 7-zip, for example.  The installation
package contains dirent.h file as well as a few example programs.


## Install Dirent for All Programs

To make dirent.h available for all C/C++ programs, simply copy the
``include/dirent.h`` file to the system include directory.  System include
directory contains header files such as assert.h and windows.h.  In Visual
Studio 2008, for example, the system include may be found at
``C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\include``.

Everything you need is included in the single dirent.h file, and you can
start using Dirent immediately -- there is no need to add files to your
Visual Studio project.


## Embed Dirent into Your Own Project

If you wish to distribute dirent.h alongside with your own source code, then
copy ``include/dirent.h`` file to a new sub-directory within your project and
add that directory to include path on Windows while omitting the directory
under Linux/UNIX.  This allows your project to be compiled against native
dirent.h on Linux/UNIX while substituting the functionality on Microsoft
Windows.


## Building Example Programs

The installation package contains some example programs and tests under
the directories examples and tests.  To run these programs, install
[CMake](https://cmake.org/)

Open command prompt, navigate to dirent directory with cd and generate
build files as

```
cmake .
```

Load the generated dirent.sln file into Visual Studio and build the
solution.  Run the example programs from command prompt as

```
Debug\updatedb c:\
Debug\locate cmd.exe
Debug\ls .
Debug\find .
```

# Alternatives to Dirent

I ported Dirent to Microsoft Windows in 1998 when only a few alternatives
were available.  However, the situation has changed since then and nowadays
both [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com) and [MingW](http://www.mingw.org)
allow you to compile a great number of UNIX programs in Microsoft Windows.
They both provide a full dirent API as well as many other UNIX APIs.  MingW
can even be used for commercial applications!
