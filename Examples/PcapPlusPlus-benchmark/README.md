PcapPlusPlus Benchmark
======================

This is a benchmark application used for measuring PcapPlusPlus performance. It is based on Matias Fontanini's packet-capture-benchmarks project (https://github.com/mfontanini/packet-capture-benchmarks).

See this page for more details: http://seladb.github.io/PcapPlusPlus-Doc/benchmark.html

This application currently compiles on Linux only (where benchmark was running on)
