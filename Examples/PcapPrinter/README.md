Pcap Printer
============

This application takes a pcap or pcapng file, parses its packets using Packet++ and output each layer in each packet as a readable string (quite similar to the way Wireshark shows packets).
In addition it prints a short summary of the file (with details such as file name, size, etc.)

The result is printed to stdout (by default) or to a file (if specified). It can also print only the first X packets of a file
