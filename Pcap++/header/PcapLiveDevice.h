	 * @class PcapLiveDevice
	 * A class that wraps a network interface (each of the interfaces listed in ifconfig/ipconfig).
	 * This class wraps the libpcap capabilities of capturing packets from the network, filtering packets and sending packets back to the network.
	 * This class is relevant for Linux applications only. On Windows the WinPcapLiveDevice (which inherits this class) is used. Both classes are
	 * almost similar in capabilities, the main difference between them is adapting some capabilities to the specific OS.
	 * This class cannot be instantiated by the user (it has a private constructor), as network interfaces aren't dynamic. Instances of
	 * this class (one instance per network interface) are created by PcapLiveDeviceList singleton on application startup and the user can get
	 * access to them by using PcapLiveDeviceList public methods such as PcapLiveDeviceList#getPcapLiveDeviceByIp()<BR>
	 * Main capabilities of this class:
	 * - Get all available information for this network interfaces such as name, IP addresses, MAC address, MTU, etc. This information is taken
	 * from both libpcap and the OS
	 * - Capture packets from the network. Capturing is always conducted on a different thread. PcapPlusPlus creates this
	 * thread when capturing starts and kills it when capturing ends. This prevents the application from being stuck while waiting for packets or
	 * processing them. Currently only one capturing thread is allowed, so when the interface is in capture mode, no further capturing is allowed.
	 * In addition to capturing the user can get stats on packets that were received by the application, dropped by the NIC (due to full
	 * NIC buffers), etc. Stats collection can be initiated by the user by calling getStatistics() or be pushed to the user periodically by
	 * supplying a callback and a timeout to startCapture()
	 * - Send packets back to the network. Sending the packets is done on the caller thread. No additional threads are created for this task
