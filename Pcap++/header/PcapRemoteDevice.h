	/**
	 * @class PcapRemoteDevice
	 * A class that provides a C++ wrapper for WinPcap/Npcap Remote Capture feature. This feature allows to interact to a remote machine and capture
	 * packets that are being transmitted on the remote network interfaces. This requires a remote daemon (called rpcapd) which performs the
	 * capture and sends data back and the local client (represented by PcapRemoteDevice) that sends the appropriate commands and receives the
	 * captured data. You can read more about this feature in WinPcap Remote Capture manual: https://www.winpcap.org/docs/docs_412/html/group__remote.html<BR>
	 * Since this feature is supported in WinPcap and Npcap only and not in libpcap, PcapRemoteDevice can only be used in Windows only.<BR>
	 * This class provides a wrapper for the local client, meaning it assumes the daemon (rpcapd) is already running on the remote machine and it
	 * tries to connect to it and start receiving/sending packets from/to it. This class assumes rpcapd is in passive mode, meaning
	 * PcapRemoteDevice connects to the remote daemon, sends the appropriate commands to it, and starts capturing packets, rather than letting the
	 * daemon connect to the client by itself. Using PcapRemoteDevice is very similar to using the other live devices (PcapLiveDevice or
	 * WinPcapLiveDevice), meaning the API's are the same and the same logic is used (for example: capturing is done on a different thread,
	 * sending packets are done on the same thread, etc.). For the full API and explanations, please refer to PcapLiveDevice. The reason for the
	 * similar API is that WinPcap/Npcap's API is very similar between Remote Capture and local network interface capture. The things that are different
	 * are some are some implementation details, mainly in making the connection to the remote daemon, and the way the user can get the instance
	 * of PcapRemoteDevice. For more details on that please refer to PcapRemoteDeviceList
