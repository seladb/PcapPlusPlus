	 * and runs on a designated core. When it runs it can do whatever the user wants it to do. The most common use it running in an
	 * endless loop and receive, analyze and send packets using one or more DpdkDevice instances. It can do all kinds of processing for
	 * these packets. The only restriction for a worker class is that it must implement the 3 abstract methods stated in this class-interface
	 * for start running, stop running and get the core ID the worker is running on.

		 * A static method that has to be called once at the startup of every application that uses DPDK. It does several things:

		 *    - initializes the DPDK infrastructure

		 * @param[in] coreMask The cores to initialize DPDK with. After initialization, DPDK will only be able to use these cores
		 * for its work. The core mask should have a bit set for every core to use. For example: if the user want to use cores 1,2
		 * the core mask should be 6 (binary: 110)
		 * @param[in] mBufPoolSizePerDevice The mbuf pool size each DpdkDevice will have. This has to be a number which is a power of 2
		 * minus 1, for example: 1023 (= 2^10-1) or 4,294,967,295 (= 2^32-1), etc. This is a DPDK limitation, not PcapPlusPlus.
		 * The size of the mbuf pool size dictates how many packets can be handled by the application at the same time. For example: if
		 * pool size is 1023 it means that no more than 1023 packets can be handled or stored in application memory at every point in time
		 * @param[in] masterCore The core DPDK will use as master to control all worker thread. The default, unless set otherwise, is 0
		 * @return True if initialization succeeded or false if huge-pages or DPDK kernel driver are not loaded, if mBufPoolSizePerDevice
		 * isn't power of 2 minus 1, if DPDK infra initialization failed or if DpdkDevice initialization failed. Anyway, if this method
		 * returned false it's impossible to use DPDK with PcapPlusPlus. You can get some more details about mbufs and pools in
