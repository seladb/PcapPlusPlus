/**
 * @file
 * Most packet capture engines contain packet filtering capabilities. In order to set the filters there should be a known syntax user can use.
 * The most popular syntax is Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) - see more in here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter.
 * Detailed explanation of the syntax can be found here: http://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/pcap-filter.7.html.<BR>
 * The problem with BPF is that, for my opinion, the syntax is too complicated and too poorly documented. In addition the BPF filter compilers
 * may output syntax errors that are hard to understand. My experience with BPF was not good, so I decided to make the filters mechanism more
 * structured, easier to understand and less error-prone by creating classes that represent filters. Each possible filter phrase is represented
 * by a class. The filter, at the end, is that class.<BR>
 * For example: the filter "src host 1.1.1.1" will be represented by IPFilter instance; "dst port 80" will be represented by PortFilter, and
 * so on.<BR>
 * So what about complex filters that involve "and", "or"? There are also 2 classes: AndFilter and OrFilter that can store more filters (in a
 * composite idea) and connect them by "and" or "or". For example: "src host 1.1.1.1 and dst port 80" will be represented by an AndFilter that
 * h olds IPFilter and PortFilter inside it
