[PcapPlusPlus](https://pcapplusplus.github.io/) is a multiplatform C++ library for capturing, parsing and crafting of network packets. It is designed to be efficient, powerful and easy to use.

PcapPlusPlus enables decoding and forging capabilities for a large variety of network protocols. It also provides easy to use C++ wrappers for the most popular packet processing engines such as [libpcap](https://www.tcpdump.org/), [WinPcap](https://www.winpcap.org/), [DPDK](https://www.dpdk.org/) and [PF_RING](https://www.ntop.org/products/packet-capture/pf_ring/).

## Getting Started

Writing applications with PcapPlusPlus is very easy and intuitive. Here is a simple application that shows how to read a packet from a PCAP file and parse it:

```cpp
#include "IPv4Layer.h"
#include "Packet.h"
#include "PcapFileDevice.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    // open a pcap file for reading
    pcpp::PcapFileReaderDevice reader("1_packet.pcap");
    if (!reader.open())
    {
        printf("Error opening the pcap file\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // read the first (and only) packet from the file
    pcpp::RawPacket rawPacket;
    if (!reader.getNextPacket(rawPacket))
    {
        printf("Couldn't read the first packet in the file\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // parse the raw packet into a parsed packet
    pcpp::Packet parsedPacket(&rawPacket);

    // verify the packet is IPv4
    if (parsedPacket.isPacketOfType(pcpp::IPv4))
    {
        // extract source and dest IPs
        pcpp::IPv4Address srcIP = parsedPacket.getLayerOfType<pcpp::IPv4Layer>()->getSrcIpAddress();
        pcpp::IPv4Address destIP = parsedPacket.getLayerOfType<pcpp::IPv4Layer>()->getDstIpAddress();

        // print source and dest IPs
        printf("Source IP is '%s'; Dest IP is '%s'\n", srcIP.toString().c_str(), destIP.toString().c_str());
    }

    // close the file
    reader.close();

    return 0;
}
```

You can find much more information in the [Getting Started](https://pcapplusplus.github.io/docs/) page in PcapPlusPlus web-site. This page will walk you through few easy steps to have an app up and running.

## API Documentation

PcapPlusPlus consists of 3 libraries:

1. __Packet++__ - a library for parsing, creating and editing network packets
2. __Pcap++__ - a library for intercepting and sending packets, providing network and NIC info, stats, etc. It is actually a C++ wrapper for packet capturing engines such as libpcap, WinPcap, DPDK and PF_RING
3. __Common++__ - a library with some common code utilities used by both Packet++ and Pcap++

You can find an extensive API documentation in the [API documentation section](https://pcapplusplus.github.io/api-docs/) in PcapPlusPlus web-site.
If you see any missing data please [contact us](#provide-feedback).

## DPDK And PF_RING Support

[The Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK)](https://www.dpdk.org/) is a set of data plane libraries and network interface controller drivers for fast packet processing.

[PF_RING™](https://www.ntop.org/products/packet-capture/pf_ring/) is a new type of network socket that dramatically improves the packet capture speed.

Both frameworks provide very fast packets processing (up to line speed) and are used in many network applications such as routers, firewalls, load balancers, etc.
PcapPlusPLus provides a C++ abstraction layer over DPDK & PF_RING. This abstraction layer provides an easy to use interface that removes a lot of the boilerplate involved in using these frameworks. You can learn more by visiting the [DPDK](https://pcapplusplus.github.io/docs/dpdk) & [PF_RING](https://pcapplusplus.github.io/docs/features#pf_ring-support) support pages in PcapPlusPlus web-site.

## Benchmarks

We used Matias Fontanini's [packet-capture-benchmarks](https://github.com/mfontanini/packet-capture-benchmarks) project to compare the performance of PcapPlusPlus with other similar C++ libraries (such as `libtins` and `libcrafter`).

You can see the results in the [Benchmarks](https://pcapplusplus.github.io/docs/benchmark) page in PcapPlusPlus web-site.
